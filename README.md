# Flappy-Bird
Qt game

Flappy Bird is a very popular mobile and desktop game. In this game a player can control the vertical movement of bird. Bird free fall on the ground (under gravity) and player has to keep the bird at height by pressing up key.
Bird will seem to fly toward right side (actually there will be tubes appearing from right side and bird would be still in the horizontal plane).
There will be small holes in between pipes and the goal of the game is to control the vertical movement of the bird by dodging and passing the incoming tubes. The game will end only when the bird is hit by tube, ground or ceiling.
This clone will also have some improvisation with the original flappy bird game such that hunters at ground and some boost-ups.
The game is mainly targeted for desktop computers but the android version is also in the queue. Windows and linux operating systems are primary operating systems for the game.

Qt framework of C++ is used to build the game. Build tool is Qmake.
